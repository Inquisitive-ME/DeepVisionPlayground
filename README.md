# DeepVision Playground

DeepVision Playground is an open-source, hands-on platform designed to demystify and explore the core neural network
concepts behind computer vision models. It provides a modular, from-scratch implementation framework that lets you
generate synthetic data, experiment with custom architectures, and implement key tasks—such as object detection,
localization, and even segmentation—in a clear and intuitive way. By building and tweaking every component yourself,
from data generation to loss function design, DeepVision Playground is an educational sandbox that encourages a deep,
practical understanding of how deep learning operates on visual data.
