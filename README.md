# DeepVision Playground

DeepVision Playground is an open-source, hands-on platform designed to demystify and explore the core neural network
concepts behind computer vision models. It provides a modular, from-scratch implementation framework that lets you
generate synthetic data, experiment with custom architectures, and implement different tasks such as object detection,
localization, classification and semantic segmentation

The goal of DeepVision Playground is to be an educational sandbox that encourages a deep,
practical understanding of how deep learning operates on visual data.

## Current Status
Synthetic Shapes dataset which produces random rectangles, ellipses, and triangles on to random backgrounds
Simple model to localize center of single shape


## Todo's
Figure out how to document examples
Work on network to detect multiple objects
Lot's more
